# Vignette

Tribal forestry managers want to evaluate forestry data to determine growth rates of trees for a harvest. 

*We should flesh this out a little more.*

# WORKSHOP: Learning goals (More for us as a team, rather than for SKC students)

The goal of the first day of the this forestry module is to have the students replicate what they did in the first 3 modules all at once and to do so more independently than previously. 

Things this module should include are: 

1. Min, max, median, mean review.  

2. Maximum sustained yield. 

3. More time-series exploration

4. More complex data vizualization.
