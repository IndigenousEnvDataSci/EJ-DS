# Environmental Justice and Data Science Modules Collaboration - Introduction to Statistics in R 

This repository is currently the work space for a multi-institution EJ
data science collaboration.

Modules 1-3 were used as labs in a lower-division Introduction to R Statistics course in the Wildlife and Fisheries Department at Salish Kootenai College during Winter quarter 2024. The class met once a week for 2 hours over 10 weeks. The format of the class was that the first hour included instruction and discussion, and the second hour students worked collaboratively through the lesson. Each module took up to three weeks (6 hour of class time) to complete, including time spent outside of class. 

Content is being updated for Winter 2025. 

# Contents of each module

-   Rmarkdown file that includes all instruction, discussion questions, and code
-   knitted Rmarkdown as html for example of completed code 
-   dataset (dummy dataset, but based on real data)
-   R script with code used to create dataset and any other supporting R files 
-   any relevant literature
